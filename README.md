Background

You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

Analysis

Our goal is to analyze how Capomulin, an anti-cancer medication stood against other drug regimens over a 45 day period, utilizing a sample size of 249 mice
Capomulin was the most comparable to the drug Ramicane, and as we can see by the box plot of the final tumor volume, Capomulin is more effecive than Ceftamine and Infubinol
The heavier the mouse, the larger the tumor, yet Capomulin still effectively shrinks the tumor
Furthermore, there are no outliers for Capomulin. It can be concluded that Capomulin does a good job at reducing the size of tumor in the mice
